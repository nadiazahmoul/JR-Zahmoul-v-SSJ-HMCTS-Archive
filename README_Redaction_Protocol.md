Public Document Redaction Protocol

JR-Zahmoul-v-SSJ-HMCTS GitHub Archive

1. Purpose and governing standard

This protocol governs the redaction of documents uploaded to the public GitHub repository associated with Zahmoul v Secretary of State for Justice & HMCTS (Administrative Court ref. AC-2025-LON-004293).

Governing standard:

Documents are redacted only to the extent necessary to comply with
(a) data-protection obligations, and
(b) established court publication practice,
while preserving evidential integrity, accountability, and public-interest transparency.

Redactions are minimal, rule-based, content-neutral, and reversible.

2. Scope

This protocol applies to:

Exhibits

Evidence bundles

Correspondence

Schedules

Medical or safeguarding material

This protocol does not apply to:

Court orders or judgments already published unredacted by the court

Legal argument where no personal data is present

3. Mandatory redactions (always applied)

The following categories must always be redacted, without discretion:

🔴 Personal data (UK GDPR)

Home addresses

Personal (non-institutional) email addresses

Telephone numbers

Dates of birth

National Insurance numbers

NHS / medical record identifiers

Bank or financial account details

Handwritten signatures

Standard redaction marker:

[REDACTED – PERSONAL DATA]

🔴 Protected individuals

Names or identifying details of:

children

private individuals not acting in a professional or official capacity

third parties with no procedural role in the litigation

4. Partial redactions (role-preserving)

Where individuals act in an official or professional capacity, apply role-based redaction only.

🟠 Redact:

personal identifiers beyond what is necessary

🟢 Preserve:

job title

organisational affiliation

decision-making responsibility

Example:

Jane Smith → HMCTS Caseworker [Name Redacted]


This preserves accountability without unnecessary personal exposure.

5. Material that must NOT be redacted

The following must never be redacted, as they go directly to accountability and public interest:

🟢 Institutional and procedural material OS

Names of:

judges

ministers

senior civil servants

solicitors and counsel

law firms

Court names and divisions

Case numbers

Hearing dates

Procedural history

References to evidence custody, handling, delay, loss, or misadministration

Institutional email addresses (e.g. @justice.gov.uk, @withersworldwide.com)

Presumption rule:
If the material would ordinarily appear in a reported judgment, it remains visible.

6. Technical redaction method (non-negotiable)
❌ Prohibited methods

Black boxes in Word or Google Docs

“Hidden text”

Screenshots

Layered PDFs without applied redaction

These methods are reversible and non-compliant.

✅ Required method

Use Adobe Acrobat → Tools → Redact

Mark content for redaction

Apply redactions

Save as a new file

Verification (mandatory)

After saving:

Attempt to copy text beneath a redaction

If text is recoverable → the redaction has failed and must be reapplied

7. Versioning and reversibility

For every redacted document:

An unredacted master copy is retained offline

A clearly labelled public version is published

File-naming convention
YYYY-MM-DD_[Document_Description]_Redacted_Public_Version.pdf


Example:

2025-12-01_Exhibits_Redacted_Public_Version.pdf


This ensures auditability and reversibility if ordered by the court.

8. Repository disclosure statement (README language)

Folders containing redacted documents should include (or reference) the following statement:

Documents in this folder are redacted public versions prepared in accordance with a rule-based redaction protocol. Redactions are limited to personal data and non-public identifiers, consistent with court publication standards. No evidential, procedural, or accountability-relevant material has been removed.

9. Presumption rule (critical)

When in doubt:

Redact identity, not substance.
Preserve facts, actions, dates, responsibility, and chronology.

10. Rationale

This protocol:

aligns with court publication practice

complies with GDPR minimisation

avoids selective or narrative redaction

preserves evidential weight

protects third parties

supports public-interest transparency

It can be justified in one paragraph if ever challenged.
