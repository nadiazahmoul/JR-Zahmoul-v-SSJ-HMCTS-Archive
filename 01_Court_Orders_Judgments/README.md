# 01 — Court Orders & Judgments  
This folder contains all official court orders, judgments, sealed applications, and procedural decisions relevant to the judicial proceedings involving **Zahmoul v Secretary of State for Justice & HMCTS**.

---

## Contents  
This folder includes:
- Orders of the High Court  
- Orders of the Court of Appeal  
- N161 Appellant’s Notices  
- N244 Applications to Reopen  
- Refusal & Directions Orders

## Naming Convention  
All documents follow the ISO date structure:

This ensures:
- strict chronological sorting,  
- forensic auditability,  
- ease of reference for journalists, oversight bodies, legal reviewers, and researchers.

## Purpose of This Folder  
To maintain a transparent, publicly accessible record of:
- the judicial decisions made before the JR was initiated,  
- the appellate attempts, refusals, and directions,  
- the procedural path demonstrating the exhaustion of remedies,  
- the court's treatment of issues leading to the JR,  
- and the institutional context within which the alleged administrative failures arose.

This folder therefore serves both as:
1. **a procedural archive**, and  
2. **an evidential foundation** for the matters raised in the Judicial Review.

---

## Public Interest Context  
Because the JR names the **Deputy Prime Minister / Secretary of State for Justice** as Defendant and raises allegations concerning **misadministration of potential criminal-relevant evidence**, the accuracy and accessibility of the court record are essential for:
- parliamentary oversight,  
- journalistic scrutiny,  
- research and public accountability,  
- and ensuring clarity of the chronology.

This folder provides the neutral, official document trail against which all later filings can be assessed.
